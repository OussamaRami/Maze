        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>When I was a kid, I lets say 7 years old year 2007, I remember the time when my father bought a DVD player for playing movies.
            I still remember when he used to take a CD from the envelope and insert it into the DVD player. 
            What I didn't know, and what came as a surprise, was that one of the CDs he bought contained a video game, more precisely a collection of games.
            Initially, I was hooked, playing the whole day and inviting my friends to play together. 
            Whether it was Super Mario or a 2D shooter, it was fun. 
            So, I started liking games from then on. 
            In the couple of years after that 3 years to be exact, It was the time when I was introduced to a PC for the first time,I played alot of games and of course I wanted to make a game, but I didn't know how or where to start, and I was very frustrated. 
            But now, I have an opportunity to make that childhood dream come true, so I decided to choose this project.</p>

        <p>This is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/OussamaRami/Maze">GitHub</a>.</p>
